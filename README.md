# DerpQuest
C# Final Project from 2015

This project is a text-based adventure game written in C#, using version 4.5 of the .NET framework. Understandably it's probably dated compared to something you could make today.
I included a lot of referential humor from back in the day, including some references to Nethack, Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail, Sierra and Lucasgames adventure games, and 
possibly Homestuck. There isn't anything keeping the program from terminating so attempting to run this in Windows will cause the game to terminate and cut out some funny messages. I 
still need to test this out on the command line, I think it's possible to see some of the things you can't in Windows. But it's all here in the source code. The project will eventually be safe to 
download from danielsprojects.net.
